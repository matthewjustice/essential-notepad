# Essential Notepad
A basic Notepad implementation for Windows

## About
With all the new features in Notepad for Windows 11, I thought it might be nice to reimplement "classic" Notepad. Why? Just because I like programming in C using the Windows API. Also, maybe someone will find the code helpful as an example.

## Status
This is a work in progress. The current code should work fine, but it isn't feature complete.

## Building
I've been building the project with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2017, including C/C++ tooling. Why VS 2017 in particular? Because I already had it installed. I expect the code will build on newer versions of Visual Studio too.

To build, open an `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` or (set with `vcvars32.bat`) and run `build.cmd` in the `src` directory.
